# Todo app

A Todo task tracking and management app that is inspired from issues faced when doing my intern.

I found tracking epics and its requirements difficult, especially with excel. What I had to do was break down epics into features, features into requirements, requirements into its detailed steps. I found this nesting really hard to visualize with excel.

While arranging them similar to folders structure will be a better option, this application aims to display folder structures in a more elegant way... or something.

Look, can I use some current note taking app as a substitute for excel and save me however long to make my own one? Yes, yes I can. Leave me alone, I just want to make something I thought is cool.
